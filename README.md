# code-refactor

## Description
I was given an existing code that needed to be refactored. The code lacked some accesibilites, there was a broken navigation link, the html did not have semantic elements, and the CSS code could use consolidation.

I removed added accesibilities to the images with the, alt="description of image" inside of the image html code. I changed the title from "website" to something that could do better with SEO.

I substited all div elements with structured semantic elements. I then changed the CSS in accordance with semantic element changes, so that the style changes would be reflected. Lastly, I consolidated the CSS and added comments to all the areas where consolidation was completed.
